    <h1>Chemistry Assignments</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition and behaviour of matter. It is
        fascinating that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The <mark> periodic table </mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by
        its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups
        and periods based on their properties.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Chemical Equation</h3>
    <p>
        Chemical reactions are represented using <dfn>chemical equations</dfn> . Here's an example of a <dfn>chemical
            reaction</dfn>:
        <br>
        2H <sub>2</sub> <var>+</var> O <sub>2</sub> â†’ 2H <sub>2</sub>O
        <br>
        This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<dfn>H <sub>2</sub></dfn>) and oxygen gas
        (<dfn>O<sub>2</sub></dfn>) to form water (<dfn>H<sub>2</sub>O</dfn>).

    </p>

    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p> <b>Stoichiometry</b> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing
        chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
        <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup>
        represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.

    </p>

    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>
        Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe
        to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
